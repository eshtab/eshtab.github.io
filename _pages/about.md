About Me
======

I am a 4th year PhD candidate at the Faculty of Information at University of Toronto studying data practices in machine learning and environmental sustainability. My research interests include
 examining concerns of fairness, accountability, and transparency in ML dataset development, developing methods to promote reflexivity in data work, and designing data curation interventions for ML. 

I am supervised by <a href="https://www.christoph-becker.info/">Prof. Christoph Becker</a> 
and work with the <a href="https://justsustainabilitydesign.org/">Just Sustainability Design lab</a>. 
</br></br>

I explore a variety of related questions in this area 
including: how dataset development processes within machine learning research can be improved with the 
adoption of data curation principles, concerns of fairness, accountability, and transparency in data work, 
and how to design interventions in data practices to aid in decision-making for 
environmental sustainability. If any of these areas are of interest to you, please get in touch to collaborate.
