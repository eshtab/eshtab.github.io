About Me
======

I am a 4th year PhD candidate in the Faculty of Information at University of Toronto studying data practices in machine learning. My research interests include
 examining concerns of fairness, accountability, and transparency in ML dataset development, developing methods to promote reflexivity 
 in data work, and designing data curation interventions for ML. 
 
I explore a variety of related questions in this area 
including: how dataset development processes within machine learning research can be improved with the 
adoption of data curation principles, how to develop tailored curation strategies for ML groups, and how to redefine what progress in ML means 
by realigning prioritizations and cultural norms surrounding data practices. Further details about my research interests can be found [here](https://eshtab.github.io/aboutme/).

If any of these areas are of interest to you, please get in touch to collaborate. 

I am supervised by <a href="https://www.christoph-becker.info/">Prof. Christoph Becker</a> 
and work with the <a href="https://justsustainabilitydesign.org/">Just Sustainability Design lab</a>.
