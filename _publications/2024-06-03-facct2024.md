This paper examines data practices in machine learning
dataset development through the lens of data curation. We develop a framework for evaluating machine learning datasets using data
curation concepts and principles through a rubric. Through a mixed-methods analysis of evaluation results
for 25 ML datasets, we study the feasibility of data curation principles to be adopted for machine learning data
work in practice and explore how data curation is currently performed.
