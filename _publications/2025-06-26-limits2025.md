This paper explores
whether the World3-03 model is a feasible method to quantitatively simulate
the impact of data centers on limits to growth. We reflect
on these dynamics by adding new variables to the model in order
to simulate a new AI-augmented scenario. We find that through
our addition of AI-related variables (such as increasing data cen-
ter development) impacting pollution in the World3-03 model, we
can observe the expected changes to dynamics, demonstrating the
viability of the World3-03 model for examining AIâ€™s impact on
planetary boundaries.
