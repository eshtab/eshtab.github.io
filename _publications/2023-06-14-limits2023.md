This paper attends to five key tensions in this design space by demonstrating how design theories can reorient the design process for computing systems used in both top-down decision-making and bottom-up community effort. More specifically, we investigate how four design approaches (Social Design, Speculative Design, Feminist Data Practices, Design Justice) can be applied to a tool for empowering community efforts and informing decision-making for climate change.
